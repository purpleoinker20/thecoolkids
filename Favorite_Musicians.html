	<h1>Favorite Musicians</h1>
		<p> 
			<i>When I was younger, these were the type of musicians I would listen to get inspired when doing something creative<br>
			Although I still do listen to them today, but I wouldn't say I listen to them as much as often</i>

			<h2>Shawn Wasabi</h2>

						When I was younger I would listen to Wasabi because his music is really colorful. <br> If you were to ask me how would I describe him as a musician he would be like a rainbow

			<h2> December Avenue</h2>

						These guys are legit old school. I gues this is the closest time I underwent the emo stage. Sad songs <br>and breakup songs (even though I never went a relationship &lt;/3
